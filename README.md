This is the Machine Learning project By Guillaume Paya-Monet, Guillaume Loranchet and Junki Hong

This project is about facial recognition.

run new_user.py to take pictures, select the correct ones and create a tar file (necessary in project_ML.ipynb)

For project_ML.ipynb, open in colab and do 'save a copy in GitHub' after modification.

Look at images.ipynb for an example of managing images with tf.data
