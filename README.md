# ML_proj

This is the Machine Learning project By Guillaume Paya-Monet, Guillaume Loranchet and Junki Hong

This project is about facial recognition with a small dataset.

-run 'new_user.py' to take pictures, select the correct ones and create a tar file (necessary in project_ML.ipynb)

OR

-run 'create_data.py', 'check_data.py' and then 'make_tar.py'

new_pic, new_pic(1)... are the files containing the training set and next_ite contains the testing set.

For 'project_ML.ipynb', 'CNN.ipynb' and 'kNN.ipynb', open in colab and do 'save a copy in GitHub' after modification.
