# ML_proj

This is the Machine Learning project By Guillaume Paya-Monet, Guillaume Loranchet and Junki Hong

This project is about facial recognition.

First run create_data.py, then check_photos.py.

And finally reset.py to erase all photos.

Before opening project_ML.ipynb, run 'tar -zcvf next_ite.tar.gz next_ite' on a linux terminal to create a tar file of next_ite (neccesary in project_ML).

For project_ML.ipynb, open in colab and do 'save a copy in GitHub' after modification.

Look at images.ipynb for an example of managing images with tf.data
