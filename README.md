# ML_proj

This is the Machine Learning project By Guillaume Paya-Monet, Guillaume Loranchet and Junki Hong

This project is about facial recognition.

First run create_data.py, then check_photos.py.

And finally reset.py to erase all photos.

For project_ML.ipynb, open in colab and do 'save a copy in GitHub' after modification.
