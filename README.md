# ML_proj

This is the Machine Learning project By Guillaume Paya-Monet, Guillaume Loranchet and Junki Hong

This project is about facial recognition with a small dataset.

The machine learning part is mostly in the @Notebook folder with three Google colabs files for three different methods: 'project_ML.ipynb', 'CNN.ipynb' and 'kNN.ipynb'

After modification, do 'save a copy in GitHub'

To add new images, you can either:
-run 'new_user.py' that takes pictures, selects the correct ones and creates a tar file (necessary in project_ML.ipynb)

OR

-run 'create_data.py', 'check_data.py' and then 'make_tar.py'

new_pic, new_pic(1)... are the files containing the training set and next_ite contains the testing set.
